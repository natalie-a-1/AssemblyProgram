# AssemblyProgram

This was the final project for my Computer Organization course at The University of Oklahoma. We were informed to use 
the assembly language in Computer System Architecture, by M. Morris Mano, Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1993, Third Edition. to complete this project.
My code takes in a two digit number in the hexadecimal-octal form and converts the number to its decimal equivalence.
Then, a method sums up all even numbers from zero to the decimal number and finally ouputs the sum.
